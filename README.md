## 🏃 Usage

1. Prepare your dataset inside a `data` folder:

```
data/
 ├── train/
 │    ├── class_1/
 │    └── class_2/
 ├── val/
 │    ├── class_1/
 │    └── class_2/
 └── test/
      ├── class_1/
      └── class_2/
```

2. Train the model:

```bash
python train.py
```

3. Evaluate the model:

```python
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%")
```

4. Make predictions:

```python
new_model.predict(np.expand_dims(image/255, 0))
```

## 🔬 Business Impact

* **Healthcare**: Accurate detection minimizes false negatives in medical imaging.
* **Manufacturing**: Ensures high-quality defect detection with minimal misses.
* **Security**: Reduces false alarms while detecting real threats reliably.

Would you like me to add a **confusion matrix heatmap image generation script** in the README as well (so others can visualize results)?
